# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Alan Villalta, and I come from a small town in Texas.
I grew up playing video games and messing around with computers.
Since I was little, I have always been fascinated with the technology that goes into a computer.
From the hardware to the software, the complexity of everything computers require to function properly still baffles me.
Maybe some day I will fully understand these wonderful machines.
